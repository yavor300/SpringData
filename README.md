In the course we will look in detail at working with a modern ORM technology: Hibernate, which is practically a standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate allows mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) through the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations from Java. Spring Data, in turn, further upgrades the standard API and provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process database data. In the course we will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer of complex systems in Java applications through built-in implementations of the Repository template and the use of a service layer (Service Layer), as well as import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).
